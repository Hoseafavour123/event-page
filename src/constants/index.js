    review: `I feel incredibly lucky to have been part of the LinkedIn Leadership Academy Cohort 1. It was truly eye-opening for me. The sessions were jam-packed with valuable insights, and the speakers were absolutely amazing, pouring their hearts out and sharing their wisdom with us. The academy went above and beyond my expectations in every way.
Not only did the program give me invaluable leadership skills, but it also helped me grow personally and spiritually. Plus, I got to meet and learn from some incredible people.
I'm forever grateful to Miss Aanuoluwapo Emmanuel for spearheading the LinkedIn Leadership Academy and for being such an inspiring leader. Now, I feel empowered and ready to take charge in my world.

    review: ` I’m glad I joined the first cohort of the LinkedIn Leadership Academy. The journey from day 1 to day 30 of the LinkedIn Leadership Academy was an incredible one. It was indeed impactful because the academy opened my eyes to a lot of things. One thing I love is the fact that it also talked about building a relationship with the Holy Spirit.

My goals when applying to the academy were to learn how to sharpen my leadership skills and grow my brand on LinkedIn, but what I learned surpassed my expectations. 

Aside from learning about how to grow my brand on LinkedIn, I also learned about personal growth, knowing my purpose, and how to set financial goals. Dr Rubie’s session on “The Light of the World” was an insightful one. 

I appreciate the efforts of the facilitators and the positive impact they made on me and everyone who joined the academy.

The provided resources have been so helpful. One of the resources includes a book by John Maxwell titled “What Successful People Know About Leadership.” This book has broadened my perspective on leadership. It’s a must-read for anyone who wants to be a good leader.

A lot changed about me after I joined the academy. I struggled with showing up on LinkedIn before I joined the LinkedIn Leadership Academy. However, while participating, I became more consistent with posting on LinkedIn.

I’ll recommend the LinkedIn Leadership Academy to anyone who wants to become a good leader, develop themselves financially and spiritually, and grow in every other aspect of their life.
